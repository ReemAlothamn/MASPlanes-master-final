/**
 * Factor that selects the best <em>k</em> active neighbor but doesn't constraint others.
 * <p/>
 * This is very similar to the {@link IndependentFactor}, but in this case the utility obtained by
 * the factor is that of only the best <em>k</em> active neighbors (instead of all of them).
 * Formally, this factor is defined over a sequence of neighbors <em>X = {x_1, ..., x_n}</em>, a
 * sequence of corresponding weights <em>B = {b_1, ..., b_n}, b_i > 0</Ã«m>, and a maximum number
 * of contributing neighbors <em>k</em>. Then, the factor is defined as
 * <pre>
 *      f(X,B,k) = max_{s \in {X \choose min(n_a, k)}} \sum_{x_i \in s} b_i,
 * </pre>
 * where <em>n_a = \sum x_i</em> is the number of active variables.
 *
 * Messages from this factor can be computed in <em>O(n log(k))</em> time. First, the maximization
 * cases are divided in two groups: those where <em>n_a <= k</em> and those where <em>n_a > k</em>.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of the factor's identity.
