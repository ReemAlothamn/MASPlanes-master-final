/**
 * Factor that selects the best active neighbor but doesn't constraint others. This is very similar
 * to the {@link SelectorFactor}, but in this case other neighbors are allowed to be active
 * at the same time (without an increase in utility).
 * <p/>
 * Formally, this factor is defined over a sequence of neighbors <em>X = {x_1, ..., x_n}</em> and a
 * sequence of corresponding weights <em>B = {b_1, ..., b_n}, b_i > 0</ëm>. Then, the factor is
 * defined as
 * <pre>
 *      f(X,B) = max_{i=1..n | x_i=1} b_i*x_i
 * </pre>
 *
 * Messages are computed in O(n) time by using the derivation:
 * <pre>
 *      v_{f->x_i} = max(b_i, b*_i) - max(-v*_i, b*_i)
 * </pre>
 * which is a simplification of the message
 * <pre>
 *      \mu_{f->x_i}(0) = max( 0, v*_i + b*_i )
 *      \mu_{f->x_i}(1) = v*_i + max( b_i, b*_i )
 * </pre>
 * where
 * <pre>
 *      b*   = max_i[ b_i + min(v_i, 0) ] ,
 *      i*   = argmax_i[ b_i + min(v_i, 0) ] ,
 *      b**  = max_{i != i*}[ b_i + min(v_i, 0) ] ,
 *      b*_i = b** if i=i*, b* otherwise ,
 *      v*   = \sum max(v_i, 0) ,
 *      v*_i = v* - max(v_i, 0) ,
 * </pre>
 *
 * Intuitively,
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code b*} is the max b value that can be achieved (penalized if the
 * corresponding  message is negative)</li>
 * <li>{@code i*} is the index of that best b value</li>
 * <li>{@code b**} is the second best b value (penalized if needed)</li>
 * <li>{@code b*_i} is the best (penalized) b value excluding neighbor {@code i}</li>
 * <li>{@code v*} is the sum of all positive messages
 * <li>{@code v*_i} is the sum of all positive messages excluding the one from neighbor {@code i}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> Type of the factor's identity.
