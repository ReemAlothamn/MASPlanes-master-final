/**
 * Max-sum "Implication" factor.
 * <p/>
 * Given an ordered set of neighbors {x_1, ..., x_n}, this factor tries to ensure
 * that if the i-th neighbor is active (x_i = 1) all the following neighbors must
 * be active. That is, f(x_1, ..., x_n) = 0 if x_i <= x_{i+1}, for all i in [1,n-1];
 * -Infinity, otherwise
 * <p/>
 * Outgoing messages are computed in <em>O(n)</em> time. Where <em>n</em>
 * is the number of neighbors.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of the factor's identity.
